# Mall Conference

This repository contains the code and documentation for a thesis project on customer segmentation using clustering techniques. The project utilizes the Mall Customers dataset from Kaggle and implements various clustering algorithms including K-means, Agglomerative, Hierarchical, and DBSCAN.

#### Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Mall Customers dataset available on Kaggle. This dataset contains information about customers including their gender, age, annual income, and spending score.

#### Project Structure
The project is structured as follows:

**data/:** Contains the dataset files.
**CODE/:** Contains Jupyter Notebooks for data exploration, preprocessing, and model evaluation.
**results/:** Contains the results and visualizations generated during the analysis.


#### Clustering Algorithms
The following clustering algorithms were implemented and evaluated in this project:

**1.K-means Clustering:** A partition-based clustering method that partitions data points into K clusters.
**2.Agglomerative Clustering:** A hierarchical clustering method that starts with individual data points and iteratively merges clusters.
**3.Hierarchical Clustering:** A clustering method that builds a tree of clusters by recursively merging or splitting clusters.
**4.DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)**: A density-based clustering method that groups together points that are closely packed.


Results
The results of the clustering analysis, including visualizations and insights gained from the segmentation, can be found in the results/ directory.
